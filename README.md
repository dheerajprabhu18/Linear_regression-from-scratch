# Linear_regression-from-scratch
implemented a linear regression from scartch , its good for trainng large data sets which sklearn struggles due to large value of x 
for small value like 1000s sklearn does fast
learning rate is anything less then 0.5 as after that model crashes so anything between 0.1 and 0.5 is prefered
loss function reduces gradually from initial point
